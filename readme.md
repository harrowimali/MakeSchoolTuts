Hello

I'm learning IOS dev via make school but I'm stuck.


Link to tut:
https://www.makeschool.com/academy/tutorial/learn-how-to-build-make-school-notes/new-note-controller

I'm stuck on the part where it asks

"Can you add a selectedNote variable to the class to store the selected Note? Hint you need to uncomment the first commented line so the selectedNote can be assigned."

pls help
